- [x] go run: cannot run non-main package
- [x] curl and browser behave differently (Ex1.12.1): additional request '/favicon.ico'
- [x] Unnamed type

    ```go
    // unnamed type `struct{ I int }`
    var x struct{ I int }

    // named type `Foo`
    type Foo struct{ I int }
    var y Foo
    ```

    - Composite types are known as unnamed types, as they use a **type literal** to represent the structural definition of the type, instead of using a simple name identifier
    - Unnamed composite types use literals for value initialization that are composed of type (itself) and a literal text that represents the value

- [ ] So a declaration may refer to itself (like functions, types!) or to another that follows it, letting us declare recursive or [ ] mutually recursive types and functions
- [ ] `^`: bitwise XOR (bitwise exclusive OR); `&^`: bit clear (AND NOT)
